# Test File

This is a test file to demonstrate the automatic README update functionality.

When this file is committed, the GitHub Action should automatically update the README.md file to reflect the new commit in the repository activity section.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Automatic Commit Detection**: The system detects new commits automatically
2. **README Updates**: Recent commits are added to the README
3. **Timestamp Updates**: The last updated timestamp is refreshed
4. **Continuous Documentation**: The README stays current with repository changes

This test file can be removed after verifying the automation works correctly.
